# Vegetable Classification Model

## <a name="introduction"></a> Introduction :

In this innovative project, I have developed a model capable of detecting and classifying vegetable images with a high level of accuracy. The primary focus of this project is to automate several critical stages in vegetable production, such as vegetable selection and sorting, which are still often performed manually. The developed model possesses the specialized ability to classify images of specific vegetables accurately. Some of the vegetables that can be identified by this model include bean, bitter gourd, bottle gourd, brinjal, broccoli, cabbage, capsicum, carrot, cauliflower, cucumber, papaya, potato, pumpkin, radish, and tomato.
